# Spotify 2.0

## Spotify inspired clone

#### Description

I made this project mainly to practise with NextJS and
improve my front end skills.
Unfortunately, it has a lot of limitations compared with the real Spotify
mainly due to the API (limits on songs lists, songs don't update when playing from other device).
I used NextAuth for the authentication with JWT to keep track of sessions.
A NodeJS Spotify API wrapper was also used so i did not have to create a new backend on my own.
